Since Dean is 6 feet shorter than Ron, we can express Dean's height as \\( D = R - 6 \\). Substituting the value of Ron's height, we get \\( D = 15 - 6 = 9 \\) feet for Dean's height.\n\nThe depth of the water is 9 times Dean's height. Therefore, the depth of the water can be calculated as \\( 9 \times D = 9 \times 9 = 81 \\) feet. Hence, the depth of the water is 81 feet.",
