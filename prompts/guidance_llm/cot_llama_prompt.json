From the given information, we know that Danny found 66 wrappers at the park and currently has 68 wrappers in total. This means that the wrappers he found at the park are included in the total count of 68 wrappers. Therefore, the number of wrappers he had initially can be calculated by subtracting the wrappers found at the park from the total wrappers he has now:\n\n\\(x + 66 = 68\\)\n\\(x = 68 - 66\\)\n\\(x = 2\\)\n\nThus, Danny initially had 2 wrappers in his collection.",

                "problem": "After resting they decided to go for a swim. The depth of the water is 9 times Dean's height. If Ron is 15 feet tall and Dean is 6 feet shorter than Ron. How deep was the water?",
                "COT": "Let's denote Ron's height as \\( R \\) and Dean's height as \\( D \\). Given that Ron is 15 feet tall, we have \\( R = 15 \\) feet. Since Dean is 6 feet shorter than Ron, we can express Dean's height as \\( D = R - 6 \\). Substituting the value of Ron's height, we get \\( D = 15 - 6 = 9 \\) feet for Dean's height.\n\nThe depth of the water is 9 times Dean's height. Therefore, the depth of the water can be calculated as \\( 9 \times D = 9 \times 9 = 81 \\) feet. Hence, the depth of the water is 81 feet.",
